# Python Voice Assistant
## Overview
This is a Python-based voice assistant that can recognize speech and perform various tasks such as:
<br>
 * Playing YouTube videos <br>
 * Providing the current time <br>
 * Opening websites in a browser <br>
 * Exiting upon user command <br> <br>
 The assistant is built using Python libraries for speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, and web automation.<br>

## Features

 * Play YouTube videos by voice command
 * Retrieve the current time
 * Open websites in a browser
 * Exit the assistant by voice command

## Installation
### Step 1: Clone the Repository <br> 
git clone https://github.com/Ayeshakhan77/RhombixTechnologies_Tasks.git <br>
cd  RhombixTechnologies_Tasks

### Step 2: Install Dependencies  <br>
Make sure you have Python installed. Then, run: <br>
pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3 pywhatkit webbrowser  <br>

## Usage
Run the script: <br>
python voice_assist.py <br>

The assistant will greet you and wait for commands.  <br>
Speak clearly into your microphone.   <br>


## How It Works <br>
1. Uses Google Speech Recognition to convert speech to text.  <br>
2. Matches commands and performs tasks (like playing YouTube videos).  <br>
3. Uses pyttsx3 for text-to-speech responses. <br>

## Example Commands <br>
🗣️ "Play Shape of You" → Opens YouTube and plays the song  <br>
🗣️ "What time is it?" → Tells the current time  <br>
🗣️ "Open Facebook" → Opens Facebook in the browser   <br>
🗣️ "Stop" or "Exit" → Closes the assistant <br>
 
## Future Improvements <br>
🔹 Add Wikipedia search  <br>
🔹 Integrate weather updates  <br>
🔹 Open applications on your PC  <br>
